To train the long head of the bicep, Cavaliere advises moves which place the bicep behind the body, as that places a greater stretch on this part of the muscle. For example, the drag curl provides an opportunity to get the elbow back behind the body by keeping the weights close to the body throughout the movement. "The goal here is to make sure the elbow never drifts out in front of you," he says. "Keep it all the way back and try to get the dumbbell as close to your shoulder at the top as you can." Key, of course, is how you find these positions: Make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades tightly on them.

The second exercise for the long head of the bicep is the dumbbell incline curl. In this one, the angle of the bench ensures you'll be extending your arms behind your body and getting that stretch. To get an even better stretch on the long head, Cavaliere suggests contracting the triceps at the lower end of the lift.

The third long head exercise is a row curl, performed by bringing the dumbbells down to the sides of the feet, which are positioned together, and back up, utilizing that same backward elbow motion. "We're trying to initiate a dead row, but we pull them up with more of a curling motion," Cavaliere explains.

The fourth longhead move is the waiter's curl, which involves lifting just one dumbbell in a vertical motion with a grip variation: resting the top flat side of the dumbbell on your open palms takes the pressure off your forearms and more on the biceps. "The goal is to simply keep that top portion of the dumbbell flat, parallel to the ceiling and the floor, throughout the exercise," says Cavaliere. "If you don't feel like your biceps are going to pop at the top end of this, you're not doing it right.
