If you think you’re too manly for a downward dog, think again. While some men might think yoga is strictly for the ladies, the very first yogis were actually exclusively men. In fact, you may be one of the only guys who hasn’t tried these positions yet—and in other news, you can wear leggings, too.

Yoga, which has been around for over 5,000 years, is one of the most popular forms of exercise for men and women alike. According to Dr. Lisa Blum, PT, DPT, CYT of Shift Wellness, yoga began as a male-only practice that included asana (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), and meditation. It was seen as a way to improve both flexibility and strength while calming the mind. The “feminine” stereotype associated with yoga only began when it was westernized—so just like Pilates, many American dudes scoff only because they don't understand.

Part of the reason yoga has become so popular in western society is for its physical and mental health benefits. Dr. Blum states, “There is a lot of new research coming out to support the benefits of yoga on overall wellbeing, happiness, and health” and she reminds us that the benefits are “not gender specific.”

Yoga is perfect especially in the current moment, for men working from home and missing the gym. You’d be surprised how much hitting the mat can invigorate your body and mind. While there are many varieties of yoga to choose from (Bikram, restorative, vinyasa, to name a few), the research is clear: they can all do good.
